**Image Denoising project**

In this project we have set ourselves the objective of facing the challenge of medicine “Image Denoising”. Diagnostic imaging is a fundamental field in both the prevention and detection of diseases, and for this reason, treatment prior to analysis by a professional becomes a phase of great importance. **The purpose of this research is focused on the study of the different types of noise distributions that are most frequently observed and generated in magnetic resonance imaging and their elimination through the use of a specific model of Convolutional Neural Network (AUTOENCODER).** The types of noise studied are Riciano, Salt and Pepper and Gaussian. The image dataset consisting of RMI of prostates has been provided by QUIBIM S.L
